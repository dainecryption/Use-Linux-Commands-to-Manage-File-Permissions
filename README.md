<h1>Use Linux Commands to Manage File Permissions</h1>

<h2>Scenario</h2>

<i>This scenario is based on a fictional event.</i>

I'm a security professional at a large organization. I mainly work with their research team. Part of my job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions. This helps keep the system secure. 

My task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. I’ll need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, I’ll need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access. [Here's how I used Linux commands to manage file permissions](https://github.com/dainecryption/Use-Linux-Commands-to-Manage-File-Permissions/blob/main/File-permissions-in-Linux.pdf)
